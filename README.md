### 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm **Vani Singh**, a BCA student at **IME College, Ghaziabad**, affiliated with **CCS University**.

My passion for coding started when I was introduced to programming in my BCA course. I was amazed by how complex problems can be solved with logic and creativity — especially using **Python**. That curiosity turned into a serious passion, and since then, I’ve been learning consistently to become a better programmer and future software engineer.

I aspire to grow in the fields of **Software Development**, **AI**, and **Machine Learning**, and make a meaningful impact through my work.
